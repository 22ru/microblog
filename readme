I am very nostalgic for 2012-2015 anime twitter. Feel free to recreate the experience of sending out your funniest or dumbest joke to the world with this RSS feed viewer and Twitter simulator.

Under the FranHat license, you are free to use this for personal use! Feel free to reference or use my CSS, index, and RSS file. Steal my identity if you want! But please don't monetize this. I'm not making money off this either!

Your HTML file should contain both of these lines. If you don't know what to do with them, goof off a little more in HTML and come back later.
	<script src="microblog.js"></script> 
    <body onload="retrieveXML()">

XML/RSS file tag requirements:
channel
    title
    link
    description
    webMaster (optional)
    generator (optional)

    image
        url
        title
        link
    
    item
        guid
        title
        pubDate
        link
        description

These fit the minimum RSS requirements so this should be RSS reader readable.

The webmaster tag is your name. The generator tag is your username. Feel free to add your @ and verified checkmark to this one. It won't break the code if you leave either or both out (I hope).

The image tag is your profile picture. I'm using a direct link instead of a relative link but I have no idea if it makes a difference to RSS readers.

Your first post goes at the bottom and should be 0 if you choose to link it. The latest post is at the top with the highest post number. I'm not sure yet if you delete a post that it may break everything.

The pubDate tag is the date of course! You can use any string, but RSS readers like correctly formatted dates best. Generate one by typing "new Date()" in the console. Wolfram Alpha will also generate one for you if you use the keyword "epoch time" or "unix time".

The anchor in the link in <link> should match the GUID (starting at 0).

The item title is your post. Keep it under 140 characters!

The (misused) item description tag is your included image(s). Use an HTML <img /> tag. This is optional and multiple images are supported. Leave the tag empty if you do not want to include any images with your post.

Config settings:
By setting these globals in your page header using <script>, you can override the defaults.

DisplayLatestPosts
    Choose the number of posts displayed on the page. Set to 0 for all posts.

    Set to 1 if you want an RSS link element on your page, set to 0 to not show.
