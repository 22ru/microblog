I miss 2015 twitter! Maybe you do too. Feel free to recreate the experience of sending out your funniest joke to the world with this RSS feed viewer and Twitter simulator.

Your HTML file should contain both of these lines. If you don't know what to do with them, goof off a little more in HTML and come back later.
	<script src="microblog.js"></script> 
    <body onload="retrieveXML()">

XML/RSS file tag requirements:
channel
    title
    link
    description
    webMaster (optional)
    generator (optional)

    image
        url
        title
        link
    
    item
        guid
        title
        pubDate
        link
        description

These fit the minimum RSS requirements so this should be RSS reader readable.

The webmaster tag is your name. The generator tag is your username. Feel free to add your @ and verified checkmark to this one. It won't break the code if you leave either or both out (I hope).

The image tag is your profile picture. I'm using a direct link instead of a relative link but I have no idea if it makes a difference to RSS readers.

Your first post goes at the bottom and should be 0 if you choose to link it. The latest post is at the top with the highest post number. I'm not sure yet if you delete a post that it may break everything.

The anchor in the link in <link> should match the GUID (starting at 0).

The item title is your post. Keep it under 140 characters!

The (misused) item description tag is your included image(s). Use an HTML <img /> tag. This is optional and multiple images are supported. Leave the tag empty if you do not want to include any images with your post.
